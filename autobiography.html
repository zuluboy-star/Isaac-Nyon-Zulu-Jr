        <h2>My Autobiography</h2>
        <p>
           Every story has a starting point, and mine is a city: Monrovia, Liberia. I was born there on August 22, 2007, into a world that would shape me in ways I'm still coming to understand. Before I knew the complexities of life, my world was simple, it was my mother and father. When that world split, my universe re-centered around a single, brilliant star: my mom. She became my everything. Watching her raise my younger brother, Alvin, and me on her own wasn't just something I witnessed; it was the most important lesson of my life. She became my hero in real time, showing me through her actions what strength and sacrifice truly looked like.

School was the rhythm of my childhood, first at Soltiamon Christian School System with my family, and later at Alexander B. Cummings Model Science and Technology School, where I walked away with my diploma. But when the school books closed, another world would open up for me... One filled with the glow of a screen, the thrill of video games, and the escape of movies. I didn't know it then, but in those hours spent in digital worlds, a whisper of my future was calling to me.

High school graduation is supposed to feel like an ending, but for me, it felt like the start of a countdown. After a short time at Starz University, I felt a pull toward something bigger, a path that led far beyond the familiar streets of Monrovia. My dream was getting clearer, and it was a dream intertwined with my mother. I decided to move to India, to study at Chandigarh University, because I saw it as a launchpad. The goal wasn't just a degree; it was a promise. A promise that one day, I would build something of my own, a company that would allow me to give back to the woman who had given me everything.

Nothing can quite prepare you for the silence of a room in a country thousands of miles from everyone you love. Saying goodbye to my mom was like leaving a part of myself behind. The independence I found in India was born from necessity. Suddenly, the comfort of my mom taking care of things was gone. I had to cook, to clean, to manage my own life entirely. It was tough, but in that struggle, I found a new part of myself. I stopped waiting for instructions. I began to take initiative, to own my day, my choices, my life.

Today, my life has a simple, powerful focus. It’s the squeak of sneakers on the basketball court and the hum of a computer in a lecture hall. I’ve built a new community here, finding friendship with fellow Liberians and people from all corners of the globe. Each day is a building block. The boy who loved to play games in Monrovia is now the man learning how to build them in India.

My dream is no longer a whisper; it's a clear and driving force. I want to build a tech company from the ground up, to create worlds as immersive and exciting as the ones that captivated me as a kid. This journey is far from over. In many ways, it feels like it’s just begun.
